- intrusive methods for uncertainty quantification have high numerical costs
- adaptivity and the One-Shot approach can be used to accelerate intrusive methods
- the proposed techniques are studied for uncertainties up to order three
- acceleration techniques allow intrusive methods to compete with collocation methods
